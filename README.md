Guide to Enterprise Drupal
==========================

Patterns and Anti-Patterns for Enterprise Drupal Development.

# Project Patterns

### Drupal as a packaged product.

### Go "All In".

### Migrating to Drupal.

Drupal has an excellent [migration framework](https://drupal.org/project/migrate), you should steer well clear of any traditional [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) process.

### Drupal People.

### Managing Complexity.

# Back-end Patterns

## Strategic Patterns

### Write-through caching.

### Configuration management workflow.

## Tactical Patterns.

### Project Directory Layout.

### Use Entity Field Query (EFQ).

### Use Entity Metadata Wrapper (EMW).

### Managing and capturing configuration via persistant variables.

### Deploying changes via update hooks.

### Writing good drush commands at scale.

#### Memory issues and ```drupal_static_reset()```.

# Anti-Patterns

## Tactical Anti-Patterns

### Using Memcache as the cache backend for ```cache_form```.

Drupal's Form API uses a token unique to each user per form to prevent [CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF).

The downside to this is that ```cache_form```, the place where the CSRF busting token is stored, should always use persistant storage. Memcache uses a [LRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) algorithm to evict unpopular cache objects, making it incompatible with ```cache_form```.

>> "An unrecoverable error occurred. This form was missing from the server cache. Try reloading the page and submitting again."

If you're getting intermittant reports about the above error message it's likely that you're using non-persistant storage for the ```cache_form``` backend.

### Forgetting to filter the output of ```variable_get()```.

Even if you are capturing the value of this persistant variable in ```$conf[]``` or setting it via ```variable_set()``` in an update hook it is best to code defensively in case a system settings form is added is added later on.

__Wrong Example:__
```php
print '<a href="' . variable_get('marketing_footer_link') . '" rel="external">';
```

_Right Example:_
```php
print '<a href="' . check_url(variable_get('marketing_footer_link')) . '" rel="external">';
```

### Abusing ```drupal_goto()```.

### Using ```exit()``` instead of ```drupal_exit()```.

### Using ```static $cache``` instead of ```drupal_static()```.

# Front-end Patterns

## Strategic Patterns

### SMACCS.

## Strategic Anti-Patterns

## Tactical Patterns

## Tactical Anti-Patterns

### Not removing 'dead' CSS supplied by contrib modules.

# Migration Patterns

## Strategic Patterns

### Breaking Migrations into smaller chunks.

# Example Configuration

```php

/**
 * Flood prevention.
 * 
 * @note You may wish to relax these during the launch period of any new
 * site and gradually tighten them up as you understand your user base more.
 *
 * @see user_failed_login_user_window
 * @see user_failed_login_ip_window
 */
$conf['user_failed_login_user_limit'] = 7;
$conf['user_failed_login_ip_limit'] = 50;

/**
 * Akamai configuration.
 *
 * @note If a complete list of reverse proxies is not available in your
 * environment (for example, if you use a CDN) you may set the
 * $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable directly in settings.php.
 * Be aware, however, that it is likely that this would allow IP
 * address spoofing unless more advanced precautions are taken.
 *
 * @note We use Akamai's KONA Site Defender to prevent attackers hitting
 * origin directly.
 *
 * @warning This piece of code must come after Acquia's own reverse
 * proxy configuration to work.
 */

if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_TRUE_CLIENT_IP'])) {
  $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_TRUE_CLIENT_IP'];
}

```
